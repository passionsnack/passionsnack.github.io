PassionSnack is a community-based website where you can interact with Cities, Universities and Passions that matter to you!

Get more connected locally, spend less time searching and more time doing!

It was founded by two McGill students: Noah Dayan and Thomas Brag with the early help of programmers: Alan Yang, Justin Kat, Luiz Takei, Mengxuan Xia, Iain Mingo, Benjamin Hockley and Lixuan Tang.

The project was discontinued due to lack of funding. We would like to thank all contributors and maintainers of the website for their support.
